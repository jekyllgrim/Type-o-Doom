# Type-o-Doom

*Type-o-Doom* is a work-in-progress mod for [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads) that aims to recreate mechanics from [The Typing of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead) and other games in the "type-o-shooter" genre. Instead of shooting monsters you will be switched into typing mode and required to type words and phrases to shoot them.

At least **GZDoom 4.14.0** is required.

## Features

* A new HUD based on The Typing of The Dead

* Type to shoot! The complexity of things to type is based on how tough the monster was.

* All damage received by you is clamped to 1. Damage from non-attacks, such as environmental damage, is disabled.

* All ranged monster attacks are projectiles which you can shoot down.

* Monsters will be frozen when they start their attack animation to give you time to type.

* If you type without errors, your Perfection gauge grows, which eventually refills your HP.

Planned features:

* Item drops from monsters that you can shoot.

* More settings, such as adjusting the difficulty of typing.

* More stats.
